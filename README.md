High Integrity JavaScript

For those of you who came to the talk tonight, the slides are posted here. The easiest thing to do would probably be to view the [PDF](high-integrity.pdf), but to see it as a slide-show you can download the repo and look at slides.html.

Check back here for postings to articles on the topic.
